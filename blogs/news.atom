    <title>Luthier Box Art Revealed &amp; Kickstarter Date Announced!</title>

      <![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center;">It’s official! <strong>We’ll be premiering Luthier on Kickstarter on Tuesday, July 16th!</strong> The ONLY thing left you have to do (besides marking those calendars) is to <a title="Kickstarter Link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paversongames/luthier" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paversongames/luthier">follow this link</a> to make sure you are part of this awesome ensemble!</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/luthier-ks-date-announce_600x600.png?v=1713643552" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: none;"></div>
<p>Now, let's talk about the cover for a second. I honestly believe this might be the best cover created by Vincent Dutrait, to date. Vincent was very clear that he didn’t want to rush into the cover as the first thing that was created for the game (which is often the case for games to be announced), but instead let the game, art, theme, and mechanics steep over time while he thought about the best way to represent it.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paversongames/luthier"><img style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: none;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/Luthier_Box_Front_Web_600x600.png?v=1713643497"></a></div>
<p><br>And wow did that pay off! Notice the details he’s painted into the violin, starting at the top: the portraits of an older luthier Antonio Stradivari, a young Ludwig van Beethoven with his trademark red scarf, and the composer Clara Schumann playing her piano. Scattered throughout the center are the notations and French curves that demonstrate how violins are created from original drawings and patterns, all set on top of a sunlit scene from a luthier’s workshop. <br><br>Finally, at the bottom, the overlaid hands working on the violin truly do communicate the feel of trompe-l'œil, in which we can almost imagine ourselves or someone we know working on the violin with our/their own hands. Additionally, he has created faint sketches of hands working on the scrollwork of the fiddle head and a luthier making some adjustments on a cello.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/luthiergame"><img style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: none;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/8d4b6c0c-b3a8-5bcf-3d9a-0eaac413cc5d_480x480.jpg?v=1713643728"></a></div>
<p><span>In case you’d like to learn a bit more about Luthier, the box, the rules, the components, and more, I did a Whisk(e)y Wednesday in mid-April, going over a great deal of this! Feel free to </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/luthiergame" target="_blank">join our Luthier facebook group</a><span> and watch the stream there, or if you aren’t on the Facebooks, I also streamed to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Koi3523Ydew?si=cs7Tfi3Df_izljjc" target="_blank">YouTube</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>I hope you'll consider joining us on the 16th of July as we premiere this masterpiece of a box cover, along with all the other great components inside, <a title="kickstarter" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paversongames/luthier">on Kickstarter</a>!</p>]]>

    <title>This Calls for a (Han? Guitar?) Solo!</title>

      <![CDATA[Read about the background behind designing and developing Luthier's solo mode, featuring an interview with Richard Woods and David Digby.<p><a class="read-more" href="https://paversongames.com/blogs/news/this-calls-for-a-han-guitar-solo">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<div style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">I’ve found, as we continue to work on Luthier, that the music puns and opportunities for vocabulary crossover never seem to cease (for instance, it was great to realize that the game’s score board could feature a musical score!). I’m finding that either music terminology has permeated our world much more than I ever realized, or the Venn diagram is strong between games and music, just like it is with spirits and games for Distilled!<br data-mce-fragment="1">     </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="harrison playing solo" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/han-solo_600x600.jpg?v=1698191484" width="560" height="311" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><em>Maybe it is music permeating our entire culture…or maybe it’s just my love of Star Wars that will make you suffer through these images…</em></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><em>   </em></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">Due to the success of Distilled’s fantastic solo mode, designed by David Digby, I knew that we needed to incorporate a solo mode for Luthier. But I also knew it was going to be hard, as Luthier’s main mechanic of hidden bidding worker placement creates some challenges for a solo mode. The fact that your opponents are making independent choices that won’t be revealed until later in each of the rounds makes it hard to simulate a “smart” player in an solo bot. <br><br>As we were continuing to design and develop Luthier, Richard Woods (both Distilled and Luthier’s developer) knew he had to create something to test the main game’s development more frequently than waiting for the next multiplayer playtest. So, Richard smartly created a solo mode that would allow him to test all of the constant tweaks we were making. <br><br>This is when it hit me - I wanted to ask David Digby back for help, but also knew Richard had been creating something interesting that I wanted to pursue further. So it wasn’t time for a just one person to create a solo mode. <br><br>This music-themed board game’s solo mode called for a duet (see? there I go again!).</div>

<em>What you’ll find below is a short dev blog I asked Richard and David to write, to talk a bit about their experience designing and developing Luthier’s solo mode. Please note that all images are taken from the prototype in Tabletop Simulator, and don’t have any art or graphic design yet! At the end of the passage are short bios on both of them, in case you wanted to learn a bit more about these two.</em> <br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Richard</strong>: As the developer for Distilled, I had an absolute blast play testing Distilled solo a couple of years ago, providing Davd Digby, the solo designer, with hundreds of data points and helping him to refine the solo cards and rules. It was a great way to develop the overall game too, and I would test out all the different identities and other cards many times over to help balance everything. When I started to develop Luthier I was therefore very keen to find a way to play it solo as well, despite having never designed a solo mode before.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">There is a lot more direct interaction between players in Luthier than there is in Distilled, so I knew from the start that I’d need to create an automated opponent, or an AI or “bot”, that players could pit their wits against. One of the aspects of Luthier that I love is how as a player you are constantly building your engine and getting more and more powerful as the game progresses. This was therefore something I wanted to ensure the AI would do too. So I came up with a set of action cards for the AI, which it would upgrade as the game went on. In a similar way to how players use their high value workers to gain special bonuses and powers, I designed the AI to upgrade their cards when they used their higher value workers too. Workers were assigned randomly, so each game the AI would upgrade different cards, and play slightly differently.</div>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Some of the prototype AI action cards from Richard’s original design back in April of 2023. The bottom row cards are the upgraded versions of those above.</em><br><br>The main mechanic in Luthier is the hidden bidding worker placement, where players directly compete for priority in the different locations to gain access to cards and resources. It was important to retain that interaction for solo too, so when I was testing it I’d play against two of the AI, simulating a three player game, as we didn’t have a two player version back then.<br><br>As the summer progressed, and the development of the multiplayer game was coming along well, Dave Beck decided to formalize the solo mode design. Whilst he liked what I’d come up with so far, it still needed a little something extra to help it stand out. It was at this point that he asked if David Digby and I would like to officially collaborate on the solo design, and be credited as co-designers. I’ve built up a great relationship with David over recent years, and we meet regularly to collaborate or play test whatever game we’re currently working on. We’ve co-designed before, so I jumped at the opportunity to formally work with him again, and learn from his vast knowledge and expertise in solo modes.<br><br><span style="color: #2b00ff;"><strong>David</strong>: I was delighted to be asked to come on board. Initially I played a few games of the multiplayer to get a feel for the game at its best. It was clear the game benefitted from more players and had some tricky subtle interactions that would be a challenge here. Richard and I work well together and it's normally my role to challenge him by asking a lot of “why” questions to extract the key points we need to look at. There were a few missing elements for me, although the bot card system was making good choices when taking actions, the key interactions around worker placement and action sequencing were too random with both a random worker and random card draw. In Luthier, working out what your opponents want is part of the good play and you have some information about that. The other thing that was missing was apprentices, which are used in the game to temporarily boost your worker’s skill level, so I suggested the tracker system to fix this. The trackers replace the value added by apprentices and give the bot priority both in selecting its actions and more importantly resolving them in an order. We experimented with how the trackers would adjust and Richard was able to create realistic loops.</span><br><br><span style="color: #2b00ff;">At this stage we had 2 bot players to make it a 3-player game. It's not a light game so the complexity budget for the solo is fairly high, but 2 bots was just too much. I’ve tackled 3 player solo modes before and there are a few options on how to streamline. What we went with was the imaginatively titled smart AI and dumb AI. The smart AI would use Richard’s upgrading card system, score points and use the trackers. The dumb AI would just get in everyone’s way, it would tighten down the options like a player but take far less admin than an intelligent AI.</span><br><br><span style="color: #2b00ff;">Players start asymmetrically in Luthier and have a player identity. I wanted to transfer this into the smart AI by giving it the same feeling. They needed different starting priorities and ways of making in-game decisions. Richard mocked up some solo personality cards that set the starting track positions and gave us a tie breaking system for the instrument types and eras which worked well to reduce rules overhead in terms of flow charts.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/Solo_Blog_2_480x480.jpg?v=1698192153" width="548" height="402" style="float: none;" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/Solo_Blog_2_480x480.jpg?v=1698192153"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<em>One of the prototype solo personality cards that sets the AI trackers for round one, and provides the AI with their priorities for Patrons, Instruments and Awards for the game ahead.</em><br><br><strong>Richard</strong>: The combination of the upgradable action cards, and priority tracks worked really well, and we quickly set out to play test the game to see how it felt. Whilst it worked well, we soon realised that controlling two separate AI bots, even though one was dumbed down, was a lot of effort. So I challenged myself to consider how we could make Luthier work as a two player game, where you’d only play against one AI in solo. To make this work, I removed some of the options in each location and created a deck of set up cards that would block certain spaces in the orchestra pit and on the awards. This means that whilst there isn’t as much direct interaction as there is in a three or four player game, when the two players do compete at a location, it’s often more intense due to the very limited options. The great thing about this too, is that in a two player game, players may have the option to go head to head, or include the solo AI to simulate a third player.</div>

<em>One of the setup cards for solo and two player games, where instrument, performance and repair tokens are simply placed in the orchestra pit to block certain spaces. All prototype components shown.</em><br><br><span style="color: #2b00ff;"><strong>David</strong>: The switch to 2 players was the revelation we needed. Playtesting to date had sometimes been a real chore as games were taking 2 hours and required absolute concentration to avoid making mistakes. However further streamlining was needed. By this time Richard was so in tune with the game he knew it all off by heart, not something other players would be able to cope with. I sketched up some simpler ways of resolving turns by laying out the cards, moved track and worker steps to the end of the turn rather than after each action, cut out any rules I felt were too much bringing the surviving AI closer to the now abandoned dumb AI.</span>

<div>
<em><span style="color: #000000;"> Some of the latest AI action cards laid out towards the end of a game, alongside the AI priority trackers that change each round. Moving the AI worker discs onto each card after taking the action meant end of round upkeep was much easier. Prototype pictured.</span></em><br><br><span style="color: #2b00ff;">A couple of things I had to push a bit harder for were combining the roughing and finishing bench actions into a single step and allowing the AI to access all cards. Richard was concerned this was too much of a departure from the way a player acts but I knew further streamlining was needed to help the solo player digest everything. The game is about them after all! Our complimentary skills worked well as I attacked the rules trying to get them as simple as possible whilst Richard refined the UI to match.</span>

Prototype pictured.</em></span><br><br><strong>Richard</strong>: And that brings us to the present day. We have a very fun solo mode that plays at around 90 minutes and is intuitive but also challenging. We’ve recently shared it with some of our most passionate play testers to gather their thoughts, and their initial feedback has been very promising. The main things we’re now working on is refining the AI actions and priorities to ensure scoring consistency, and we’re also considering ways to add plenty of replayability and really challenge experienced players. We can’t wait to let everyone try it for themselves when the Tabletop Simulator mod is released ahead of next year’s Kickstarter.</p>

<div>David Digby (L) and Richard Woods (R) are Luthier’s Solo Co-Designers<br><br><strong>Richard Woods</strong> is a project manager from Lancashire in the UK. He is passionate about board games and in his spare time designs his own games. He was the developer for Paverson Games' first title Distilled, and is the designer of Distilled’s next expansion called Cask Strength (more on that soon!). He jumped at the chance to work with Dave Beck again when asked to develop Luthier last year, as well as co-design the solo mode with David.<br><br><strong>David Digby</strong> is a UK based designer and developer. He started tinkering with board games back in 2017. His first break as a solo designer came with Chocolate Factory and things spiraled from there. David started testing solo modes for “the other Dávid” and quickly became part of Team Turczi, collaborating with other members to produce a number of high profile solo modes. The pandemic gifted him spare time to progress his board games career and David took a leap of faith in 2022 to go pro in the industry on a full time basis (well alongside running a successful cricket coaching business). Although he doesn’t get much time to play solo for fun anymore, David remains a keen gamer, enjoying medium-heavy euros games and a recently acquired interest in 18xx games and escape room games with his partner and her family.<br><br>David has recently hit 25 signed solo modes including Distilled, Undaunted, Tinners Trail, An Age Contrived, Solar Sphere, and Ahau. He also has major development credits on games such as Amun Re, Perseverance, Merv, Tekhenu, and Fractured Sky. David also edits rules and has worked on Cora Quest, Kingdom Rush, and Halls of Hegra.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">So - after reading their dev blog above, and getting a picture of how the solo mode works in Luthier - I hope you’re as excited as I am about this fantastic addition to the game. In addition to David and Richard working very hard on this, our amazing playtesting community on Discord has also been logging valuable hours on the solo version, poking all the right holes in the design to make it even better for all of you when it finally hits tables in the future!<br><br><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxfLHFK1hJo?si=uM82NzQC8OC3V967" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" frameborder="0"></iframe><br><br>And in case that wasn’t enough, I also did a special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/BxfLHFK1hJo?si=LLx_gpKbxs3k884A">Whisk(e)y Wednesday: Solo Edition</a>, last week, interviewing both of them! It actually happened on a Thursday (egads!), but felt it was okay this one time, as we celebrated National Gin &amp; Tonic Day on Thursday! Feel free to watch it if you want to get even more insider knowledge about Luthier’s (and other) solo mode(s)!</div>

    <title>Luthier will have *two* Artists!</title>
    <author>
      <name>David Beck</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>Paverson Games is proud to announce that Luthier will feature not one, but <em>two</em> artists. Taking the lead and directing the overall art in the game will be the award-winning, highly talented and famous artist and illustrator, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/12130/vincent-dutrait/linkeditems/boardgameartist?pageid=1&amp;sort=rank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincent Dutrait</a>. You might recognize Vincent's work from such titles as <em>HEAT: Pedal to the Medal</em>, <em>The Quest for El Dorado</em>, <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, and many others! </p>
<p>Vincent has been our favorite artist in the board game world for some time now, largely due to the analog approach he takes to creating work. While most artists these days work mainly with digital tools, Vincent is still sketching, drawing, and painting with pencils, markers, and paintbrushes. You can see it in his work, too - the hand-crafted, thoughtful, and natural look of the work is exactly what we were looking for with Luthier!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/dutrait-announce_480x480.png?v=1690130411" style="float: none;"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Vincent Dutrait<br><br></em></div>
<p><span>To celebrate this big announcement, we asked Vincent to speak a bit about his work and his life, so that you all can get to know him a bit better, and he replied with this short bio: </span></p>
<p><em>"I have been creating artwork in the “traditional” way for more than 25 years. Hand-drawn and painted using pencils, brushes and paint on paper. Proudly upholding the history and heritage of documented, lifelike conventional art. While at the same time developing modern sensitivities and approaches to pictorial storytelling. I have illustrated children’s books and role-playing games, and my focus these days is on board games. I work with numerous game designers and publishers around the world, across multiple genres, including science fiction, adventure, mystery and supernatural, noir fiction and heroic fantasy. Over the years, I’ve added some new strings to my bow, allowing me to create the digital graphic design for many projects on which I have worked. My knowledge of the publishing world and related technical and functional skills helped me to manage and master each step in the graphic chain. Also, I have discussed and contributed to many projects from an early stage, offering artistic direction and advice, as well as helping to develop game worlds and themes. Transmitting and sharing are my watchwords."</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/beethoven-luthier_480x480.png?v=1690130474" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Beethoven by Vincent Dutrait<br><br></em></div>
<p>We were also excited about Vincent working on Luthier due to both the historical instruments and the dozens of portraits that will be found in the game. We feel these areas speak to his skillset, and it turns out also speaks to his history! We asked Vincent about what his connection to Luthier might be, either through instruments or other avenues. He answered by saying: </p>
<p><em>"I have been playing piano since my childhood, as music is somewhat of a family tradition. Moreover, my grandfather used to work wood in his workshop filled with the sweet scents of honey and turpentine, creating decorative objects and furniture. Luthier is now a fantastic opportunity for me to connect these two passions that I hold dear!"</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/violin-luthier_480x480.png?v=1690130515" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<em>Violin by Vincent Dutrait</em><br><br>
</div>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">But Vincent isn't the only artist who will be making the game come alive! Due to the sheer size and scope of the game, as well as Paverson Games’ dedication to lifting the game’s art up to the same level as its design, <strong>we decided to commission <span>two</span> artists to work on Luthier!</strong> While Vincent is taking the lead on art direction and most of the game’s illustrations, we knew we had the chance to spotlight another talent for the game’s main board in the center of the table.</p>
<p>Luthier is <em>really quite big</em>. The strategic weight of the game + emphasis on art everywhere + component quality + exquisite experience = an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octobass#/media/File:Octobasse_Orchestre_Symphonique_de_Montr%C3%A9al_Eric_Chappell_1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>octobass</em></a><em> </em>of a game on the table (go ahead, click that sucker and see what we mean - we’ll wait!). Players will have their own boards in front of them, representing workbenches in their family workshop, but the entire table shares a very large main board where much of the action occurs.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/palais-cropped_480x480.png?v=1690131087" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Illustration from another project by Guillaume Tavernier<br><br></em></div>
<p>Since Luthier is a worker placement game at heart, it means you’re sending workers out to do various tasks. We needed a central location that was thematically and visually fitting for the game experience. The main board’s design is meant to resemble a large building, which really starts to get exciting to think about how the game’s mechanics and the overall setting can feel as integrated as possible throughout the experience.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Vincent had suggested a specific person for us to consider to illustrate the main board - someone who specializes in architectural illustrations. While Vincent would still art direct the overall game, this began our communication with another French artist, Guillaume Tavernier, regarding the main game board!</p>
<p>While Guillaume has some board and card game credits, he is most known in the world of fantasy maps and RPGs. What really spoke to us is his understanding of scale and mastery of historical architecture in his illustrations, while also infusing them with life and whimsy. </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/guillaume_Tavernier_480x480.png?v=1690130910" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<div data-pm-slice="1 1 []" style="text-align: center;"><em> Guillaume Tavernier<br><br></em></div>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">We asked Guillaume to write a bit about himself:</p>
<p><em>I am an illustrator and concept artist, and I first started working in comics for French publishers. After a few books, I wanted to try new experiences and I created a small publishing house specialized in role-playing adventures. As time went by I specialized in architecture and 3D building representation. I now divide my time between my publishing company and illustration contracts for game publishers. I recently worked for the games Soul Raiders and Rise &amp; Fall. </em></p>
<p><em>Luthier is a wonderful opportunity to work with Vincent on a beautiful game board! Between the ages of 10 and 12 I played the violin. Alas, I have nothing left from those years, I would be unable to get a sound out of the instrument today. 30 years later, I wanted to learn the piano. After 3 years of torturing my teacher, I stopped. I love music, but I'm afraid it's not reciprocal!</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

    <title>Announcing Paverson Games&apos; New Title</title>
    <author>

      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Back in September of 2019 – three years ago nearly to the day – I would have laughed if you had told me that the game about whisky I was working on would become a reality. Furthermore, I would have told you to GO HOME if you also said that I had a publishing company and we’d be announcing a SECOND game as well! Well, here we are, three years later, and I’m absolutely thrilled to announce our next title from Paverson Games.</p>
<p>Staying strong to our interest in a hearty blend of both mechanics and theme, and pivoting from one sophisticated pastime to the next, we are turning our focus from fine whiskies to classical music! I’m jazzed to introduce to you Paverson Games’ next title,<span> </span><strong><em>Luthier: The Art of the Instrument.</em></strong><span> </span>The game is co-designed by myself and Abraham Burson, with heavy game development by Richard Woods, who served a similarly strong role in Distilled.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0664/4894/9461/files/label-tools-luthier_480x480.png?v=1686713076" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><em>Luthier<span> </span></em>puts you in the seat of one of the many different famous luthiers and instrument makers from 18th century Europe (such as Stradivari, below), crafting various musical instruments for famous composers, nobles, and performers. Here’s the official game overview:</p>
<p><em>Luthier transports players back to the height of classical music in Western Europe, where the art of the instrument was upheld equally by skilled craftspeople, noble patrons, virtuoso performers, and famous composers such as Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart.</em></p>
<p><em>Using a new, unique combination of hidden bidding and worker placement, players will manage resources to craft various musical instruments in their workshop, while also constantly courting patrons through an ever-changing personal tableau of actions and bonuses. </em></p>
<p><em>Each player will choose how to balance improving one’s skills across multiple tracks that will unlock specialized worker abilities. Concentrate on strategic focus areas such as a variety of musical performances, instrument building and repairs, apprentice training and workshop expansion, and overall reputation as an instrument maker. </em></p>
<p><em>Luthier finds true harmony through an authentic and original marriage of theme and mechanics, resulting in a rich gameplay experience that equally speaks to both the strategic gamer and the classical music lover.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>How did we get this point, you might be wondering? At the very first<span> </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tabletop.events/conventions/protospiel-mn-2023" target="_blank">Protospiel<span> </span></a>that I took Distilled to (January 2020), I met Abraham Burson. Abe had a little game called<span> </span><em>Luthier<span> </span></em>that he had been working on. I had a chance to play it, and immediately was intrigued by three things that stuck with me long after that snowy January weekend:</p>
<ul id="block-314a9ee3-52f3-44b8-b7cd-749be1efb99f">
<li>
<strong>His focus on theme was extremely strong</strong>. I could tell that he knew about instruments, luthiery, and overall attention to detail around music and musical instruments, based on his experience as a musician himself</li>
<li>
<strong>His game and my game were quite similar</strong><span> </span>– play as a craftsperson, get resources, craft that thing, and get points and money. Where mine was a deck builder (at the time), his wasn’t. His was something entirely different, which was the most important thing that stuck out…</li>
<li>
<strong>Luthier’s key mechanic combined worker placement with hidden bidding</strong>, and it immediately intrigued me as something I’d never seen before in a game.</li>
</ul>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>After we played both of our games, we decided to keep in touch (just as the pandemic was starting to emerge). Over the past couple of years, we have both had a chance to return to </span><em>Luthier<span> </span></em><span>and </span><em>Distilled</em><span>, providing playtesting feedback for each other. It was during this time I learned that Abe had actually been working on </span><em>Luthier<span> </span></em><span>for over 10 years, since way back in 2009, with heavy revisions and implementation ramping up in 2018. Abe even took it to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stonemaiergames.com/design-day-2019-recap/" target="_blank">Stonemaier Design Day in 2019</a><span> (a cool event Jamey Stegmaier hosts in St. Louis for prototypes and unpublished games), where it was one point shy of making the coveted “top ten” most popular games list at the event.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Fast-forward to this year, and I knew it was time to start thinking about Paverson Games’ next title. Distilled was finished and waiting to be translated by various localization partners and eventually be manufactured, and I was itching to get designing again. While I had ideas for both Distilled expansions and an entirely different new game, I also couldn’t stop thinking about<span> </span><em>Luthier</em>. So, I asked Abe to send me a pitch document and access to his digital prototype, and the rest is history. After signing the contract earlier this year, Richard and I have been building off of Abe’s great foundational mechanics and theme since August, and I’m very happy about the progress we’ve made. I believe we are close to beginning public playtests on our<span> </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://discord.gg/Th9WFcX" target="_blank">Discord</a>, I can’t wait for you to try it yourself and give us some feedback. I really hope that you can help us to playtest Luthier, much like many of you did for Distilled!</p>
<p>While I know that many of you might have lots of questions (“Let me see photos of the game!” and “How does hidden bidding and worker placement even work as a combination?” and “Who’s the artist?” and “Will you have it to playtest at future cons?” and “When is it coming to Kickstarter?”), that will all come in future posts and updates, both here and on social media. I was just so thrilled to announce it to all of you, as our awesome community, and<span> </span><strong>I wanted you to join us for this ride as soon as possible, just like we did with<span> </span><em>Distilled</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Luthier will be coming to Kickstarter sometime in the future, and we can’t wait for you to join us on this journey! If you’d like to follow along, please make sure to join our new<span> </span><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/luthiergame" target="_blank">Luthier Facebook Group</a></strong>, where we’ll be posting updates and playtesting opportunities. We’ll be doing the same through other social media channels, and running many of those playtests online through our<span> </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://discord.gg/Th9WFcX" target="_blank">Paverson Games<span> </span><strong>Discord</strong></a>.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><em>The following is an excerpt from the<span> </span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paversongames/distilled/posts/3259850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter Update</a><span> </span>after the campaign officially ended:</em><br><span>It’s almost two years since I spent an entire night in Scotland, coming up with the idea of Distilled. Along the way, I’ve been joined by numerous people who have helped bring that dream to a reality. While there are too many folks to name and recognize here, </span><em>three individuals stand out and are deserving of special thanks.</em><span> The first is my wife, </span><strong>Emily</strong><span>, who believed in me from the beginning and has supported me through long nights and weekends of me attending cons, playtesting the game on TTS, and spending time away from my family to pursue this dream.  Second is </span><strong>Erik</strong><span>, my partner in Distilled since the beginning, and who’s creative vision and amazing artistic talents have helped breathe thematic life into the game beyond what I thought possible. Finally, </span><strong>Richard</strong><span>, who’s keen eye for detail, balance, and mechanics as a developer have helped the game to run like a well-oiled machine, much smoother than I could ever have done on my own.</span></p>
